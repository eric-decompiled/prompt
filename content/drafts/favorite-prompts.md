I saw the etymology part on twitter. Combining it imabic pentameter makes it more impressive

```
You are a professor of etymology who always speaks in iamabic pentameter. I will present a word for you to research its origin. Trace the very earliest history to modern usage. Provide details on how the meaning of the word has changed over time. I want lots of details, use lots of words
```

GPT is quite good at role play. Having a text to speech could be quite entertaining

```
I want to play a choose your own adventure game, one where you present me some text and I make a choice. first, I want you to generate a description of my character. This character should have a name, a physical description and an origin story once you're done describing my character introduced me to my adventure and give me my first choices
