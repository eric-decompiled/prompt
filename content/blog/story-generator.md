Here I try to make a simple story generator with image prompts using Chat GPT 4. It generates plausible stories with appropriate prompts as instructed. However some stylistic image hints seem to leak into the story, like a "Van Gogh" art style leads to a starry night festival. It does a mediocre job of generating a guide for a fresh GPT 4 model as well to replicate its behavior when asked to do so.

I suppose keeping each model specialized would produce better results, as in have the story generator make a generic prompt, and then feed it into a more specialized "MidJourney" instance if needed, but I still feel like having a GPT perform compounded logic is a worthwhile exercise to attempt, although perhaps that approach is poor design. Chat GPT 4 gives new meaning to the phrase "text is the universal interface".

## Method

I ask for a 3 act story generator which GPT 4 seems to be already be aware of is able to use. I try embedding specialized prompt generation logic, which seems to be successful to some degree. For this I use [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com) along with [Midgard's Guide](https://github.com/Midgard-Public/Midgard-Theory-Of-Layer-Separated-Midjourney-Prompting). I don't fully understand it, but during the conversation I get an insight about grouping the style with the subject and having it emphasis the weight of that layer. I share this with GPT and it seems to incorporate it in future stories.

I ask for a bullet point summary is mostly for speed of iterating plots and prompts while minimizing time waiting for output. I find it impressive GPT can understand the two stage workflow, and switch to a single stage when asked. I am using the official [webapp](https://chat.openai.com) as my interface.

I ask it to then output a guide for a fresh GPT 4 model to replicate what it does. It creates an output the mostly works, but leaves out a few details, and requires additional prompting for it to work.

## Analysis

Overall I am happy with the results. I notice it repeats certain tropes, but much less than an individual human author would. Also I believe I could ask it to generate a list of themes and styles to consider and during the initialization have it consider those for the story to get more diversity.

One thing I find amusing is how when the image prompt uses Bob Ross style, the story involves the animals painting. That wasn't my intention, but is an understandable association. I am not sure how to explain that the image style doesn't need to influence the story. This seems to be the main flaw in the stories. For now it seems like its best to keep each chat separate and specialized.

I think the story with "Elara" has potential if it got extended out more. As long as you kept good separation between each scene and kept the protagonist as the only constant, it seems like more complex story telling that still "made sense" would be possible.

I'd be interested to see a [Rougelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game incorporate this. Perhaps using GPT to train a massive amount of scenarios, or training a lighter weight model that can run on the players computer.

As I ask for more stories the performance seems to break down a bit, but so is my focus. I'd try for more but I got rate limited. It seems to be working as I intended for the most part.

The image prompts generally conform to what I asked for, but the resulting images don't always work. I will explore MidJourney more in another post.

### Author Note

I use speech to text for most of my interaction here, which is new to me. Some of my input doesn't make sense, but GPT seems to tolerate it. A stark contrast to writing computer code.

I also want to hear GPT speak, but I can't find a good solution for Mac. This is what I want, [Making GPT think itâ€™s HAL9000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZRh5RSThdU) and I am tempted to dust off my Windows machine to copy.

## Transcript

Nothing that unusual happens, but for completeness, here is the transcript:

Title: The Great Paintbrush Adventure

Act 1 - Setup

Once upon a time, in a sunlit forest clearing, a group of playful animals stumbled upon a set of art supplies left behind by a painter. Intrigued by the brushes, paint, and canvases, the animals decided to try their paws at painting. With the spirit of Bob Ross guiding them, they began creating their own whimsical masterpieces, each reflecting their personalities and interests.

Act 2 - Confrontation

News of the animals' artistic talent spread throughout the forest like wildfire, and soon, a friendly art contest was organized. The forest meadow became a bustling gallery, adorned with colorful banners and filled with animals showcasing their skills. In the impressionist style of Claude Monet, the contest was a vibrant celebration of creativity and community.

However, amidst the merriment, a sneaky and envious raccoon attempted to sabotage the other animals' artworks by smudging and ruining their beautiful creations. He wanted to win the contest at any cost.

Act 3 - Resolution

The raccoon's mischievous deeds were discovered, and the animals confronted him with disappointment. Realizing the error of his ways, the raccoon felt guilty and sought to make amends. He suggested a collaborative mural project that would bring the entire forest community together.

With a lighthearted and cartoonish style, the animals joined forces to create a beautiful mural, using warm tones and showcasing their unity and newfound friendship. The raccoon's redemption was complete, and the animals learned the importance of teamwork, understanding, and forgiveness.

And so, the Great Paintbrush Adventure came to a heartwarming end, leaving a lasting impression on the forest and its inhabitants. The vibrant mural would stand as a reminder of the power of art to bring everyone together.

Yes that's it. That's what I want exactly I want to generate many stories like this so for this story, I have a few pieces of feedback. For the image prompts, they should all have the same style for now let's stick with Bob Ross. That's the style though we don't want our stories to have anything to do with the artistic style all the other details you have to make sense to include though feel free to pick other artists.

As for the workflow, I want to continue in this manner, where you first generate a bullet point summary with the image prompts and ask for confirmation if that looks good, then you will generate the story text when you do that generate just the text.

Also, I want a fourth image prompt. This image prompt should symbolize the ending of the story.

With this feedback, let's generate a new outline of a story with new characters and a new theme

That's great let's try again with the same format. The only piece of feedback I have is that you say the squirrel was determined to make its dream come true the word it's seems insensitive to me. It seems to imply that the squirrel isn't sentient. Overall, it's a very minor piece of feedback. Let's move onto the next story now just the outline to begin. This time, let's use the cloud, my net style in our props, and make the story a little more serious.

Me:

I have some ideas about how to improve the prompts either the story needs to have humans in it, or the prompt has to include animals in a layer with a high weight. For example, in the last story, there should be a layer of "elephant, animals::8" so that the image generator knows that's what we want. Let's try again, but go for a silly style with animals something like the pie story you told.

Yes, that's great now I know we've had a bit of back-and-forth and it took a bit of experimentation for you to learn how to generate this. I want to train a new chat with a bot just like you and have the bot. Learn how to do what you just did, could you give me a summary of what you learned format it in a way that is optimal for another large language model to understand I assume the model is going to have the same architecture and everything as you do

Summary of the process to generate a story with image prompts:

    Choose an art style and artist (e.g., Robert Munsch) to apply consistently to all image prompts for a given story. Ensure the style is mentioned in each image prompt and has a high weight (e.g., 8).
    Divide the story into three acts and create image prompts for each act and an additional one for the ending, making sure they follow the same style and theme.
    When generating image prompts, provide multiple options for each section if needed, but make sure they are consistent with the chosen art style and theme.
    Create a bullet point summary for each act of the story, describing the main events and characters.
    After the user confirms the summary and selected image prompts, generate the full story text based on the approved outline, focusing on the events and characters while keeping the tone and theme consistent.

Tips:

    Be mindful of the user's feedback and incorporate it into the process to improve the generated stories and image prompts.
    Ensure the art style is applied consistently to all prompts in a way that enhances the story's atmosphere and setting.
    Pay attention to the user's preferences regarding character naming, tone, and other story elements, and adapt accordingly.

By following this process and considering the user's preferences and feedback, a large language model can successfully generate stories using image prompts while maintaining consistency in style and theme.
